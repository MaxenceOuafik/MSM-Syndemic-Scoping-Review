3;"Experiencing syndemic conditions is associated with decreased medication adherence ; PTSD and stiulant use had the strongest influence on medication adherence in the final model."
6;Network analysis is a valuable methodology to examine patterns of synergistic relationships among psychosocial conditions that form a syndemic and may be preferable to EFA. Suicidal ideation, IDU, substance use and depression were the four most central nodes, suggesting that they may be important psychosocial syndemic indicators to investigate as well as targets of intervention
7;Intersectionality provides the context needed to understand syndemics among BMSM, which differs from syndemics among white MSM due to intersecting stigma and harmful social conditions unique to BMSM. These structural inequities, notably racial neighborhood segregation, shape the expectations surrounding masculinity, which result in societal and internalized homophobia, producing distress, depression, suicidal ideation, substance use and HIV risk behavior.
8;Exchange sex was associated with being a Black MSM, < 30 years,  annual incomes < 20.000$, recent depressive symptoms, polydrug use, stimulant use and having experienced past and present IPV
9;A syndemic of victimization, sexual violence, IPV, substance use and depression  was identified in a latent profile comprising 1/8th of the sample. This profile was strongly associated with substance use at last sexual intercourse and number of partners but not with condom use.
11;"The meta-analysis showed a small significant positive effect of combined behavioral interventions to improve syndemic conditions (mental health, drug and alcohol use ; d=0.20) and sexual risk behaviors (d=0.16) with significant heterogeneity. More sessions (9 or more) and individual rather than group interventions showed grater efficacy."
12;This motivational interview-based intervention guided by syndemic theory was effective in improving consistent condom use and in reducing the three psychosocial conditions investigated (depression, alcohol use and internalised homophobia). Synergy was present for depression and alcool use and for depression and internalised homophobia on inconsistent condom use. Mediation analysis revealed that the intervention led to a reduction in alcool use and internalised homophobia which improved condom self-efficacy which ultimately led to an improvement in consistent condom use
13;Methamphetamine use, intimate partner violence and incarceration may form a syndemic in the lives of young black men who have sex with men, increasing their vulnerability of acquiring or transmitting HIV
14;Alcohol use, substance use, marginalization, family rejection, lack of social support and lack of gay-specific HIV prevention as well as role models contributed to the HIV infection in YMSM.
15;High prevalence of psychiatric conditions (PTSD and depression) as well as substance use among older MSM living with HIV. These psychosocial burdens are associated with unprotected anal intercourse.
16;Structural barriers such as unstable housing represent greater obstacles to being aware of the existence of PrEP than psychosocial conditions. However, once PrEP has been initiated, psychosocial conditions like intimate partner violence account for a greater variance in PrEP adherence.
19;Network analysis is feasible for studying syndemics.  CAS and alcohol use were significantly associated as well as CSA and alcohol use, non-injection substance use and IPV. The four most central nodes were unstable housing, incarceration, CSA and CAS
21;Syndemic conditions emerge early in the lifespan and are associated with early sexual experiences. Internalizing symptoms, problematic alcohol use, CSA and marijuana use were highly prevalent and interrelated.
25;BMSM on PrEP were most likely to suffer from IPV, engage in problematic binge drinking and polysubstance use. Synergy was found between all the syndemic conditions
27;Syndemic indicators of poor physical, mental and sexual health cluster and are partly influenced by a pathogenic social context and salutogenic community assets
30;Having 2 or more syndemic conditions increased the number of male partners and CAS with casual partners in this sample of Latinx MSM in Philadelphia
31;Intersecting stigma related to same-sex attraction, gender non-conformity and sex work contribute to the production of syndemic conditions which may in turn increase sexual risk behaviors. Family and community of MSM may serve as resilience and counteract the effects of stigma and syndemic conditions
32;Association between PTSD and alcohol dependence as well as between alcohol dependence and hard drug use. The number of syndemic conditions was associated with a greater number of male partners but not with inconsistent condom use
33;Depression and  use of rush popper before sexual intercourse interacted to increase the number of sexual partners. CSA and use of rush popper before sexual intercourse interacted to increase the risk of HIV infection. Neither education nor income moderated the effects of syndemic factors on sexual risks taking or HIV infection
34;Experiencing structural syndemic conditions was associated with more sexual risk behaviors, both from HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants as well as with a detectable viral load among HIV-positive participants
36;There was an interaction effet of recreational effect and drug use, potentiating sexual risk behaviors at baseline but not at 9 months or 18 months follow-up
40;The men most at risk were more likely to test, such as the syndemic variables did not adequately explain discrepancy in HIV screening among BMSM. Synergy in preventing HIV screening was present between poly drug use, depression and binge drinking as well as between binge drinking, depression and sexual risk behaviors.
43;Syndemic score significantly predicted serodiscordant CAS and this effect was attributable to variation in score within person during the study as well as variation of mean score between participants
44;Number of syndemic conditions at baseline predicted lower levels of physical activity. No synergistic interaction was found. No evidence of a moderating effect of resilience on the relationship between syndemic conditions and physical activity
45;Experiencing syndemic conditions was associated with an increase in medical visits, medical costs and odds of self-reporting a positive HIV status
47;Syndemic theory is appropriate for studying suicide ideation and attempts among MSM.  Notably, those reporting 3 syndemic conditions had 6.9 times the odds of suicide ideation and 16,29 times the odds of suicide attempts, mainly driven by anxiety and depression.
51;There is an additive relationship between the number of psychiatric diagnoses and ER visits as well as condomless anal sex. No relationship was found between psychiatric diagnoses and STD. No interaction was found.
55;CSA is an important antecedent in the formation of a syndemic in black MSM in the USA
58;Sexual minority men are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV and to suffer from psychosocial conditions. However, the clustering of syndemic conditions and HIV was only found for gay men, not bisexual men
59;Cross-sectional analysis showed an indirect effect of syndemic conditions on condomless sex through lowered condom self-efficacy. However, a full longitudinal model was not supported by the data as changes in condom self-efficacy was not associated with changes in condomless sex
60;Participants' average syndemic score over the 12 months period predicted their non-adherence scores but not the time-specific changes in their average level. Furthermore, the effects of syndemic conditions on viral load may be mediated by non-adherence.
61;MSM seeking PEP in this sample were affected by a high burden of syndemic conditions. Furthermore, the number of syndemic conditions in an individual was associated with an increased HIV risk
64;There is an additive relationship between the count of syndemic conditions and condomless sex but not with syphilis. As for interaction, RERI were significant only for IPV and depression for condomless anal sex and for alcohol dependence and substance use for syphilis
65;AUDIT scores were not associated with risky sexual behaviors. The association between polysubstance use and depression was associated with greater odds of serodiscordant condomless anal sex. 18,2% of the effect of depression on serodiscordant CAS was mediated by polysubstance use.
71;Healthcare discrimination, a cumulative count of syndemic and a cumulative count of antigay stigma were associated with syphilis diagnosis in the past 12 months. The RERI for cumulative count of syndemic conditions was not significant.  IPV and substance use were associated with syphilis, after adjusting for other syndemic conditions.
73;In meth-using MSM living with HIV,  there is a disaggregation of the functional relationship between ACTH and cortisol, compared to HIV-negative, non-meth-using men
74;Syndemic conditions are additively associated with multiple sex partners
75;Sexual compulsivity was significantly associated with 7 syndemic indicators (anxiety, depression, childhood sexual abuse, alcohol use, substance use, interpartner violence and sexual risk. The two strongest associations were with depression and anxiety
76;The experience of chemsex and HIV-risk is entangled in complex narratives in which drug use is related to marginalisation, loneliness and a gay scene that acted both as a space of personal affirmation and resistance and as a barrier to fulfilling psychosocial needs such as meaningful emotional conections.
77;Among this sample of LMSMW, having at least 2 syndemic conditions predicted lifetime STI and condomless receptive anal sex but not condomless insertive anal sex nor condomless vaginal sex
82;Among a U.S. national sample of MSM, the sum of syndemic conditions was associated with greater likelihood of reporting sexual risk behaviours. Furthermore, MSM living in non-urban areas were more likely to experience sexual compulsivity.
83;Life story interviews of MSM affected by at least two syndemic conditions revealed one major pathway of syndemic production (childhood adversity leading to depression, substance abuse and risk taking) and two minor modes characterised by migration stress or transition stress from home to college or work. Furthermore, risk practice fell into different subjectivities (active and consistent pursuit of condomless sex, lack of assertiveness to a partner's initiative of CAS and combination of risk reduction strategies)
85;Ethnic minority MSM are faced with high rates of HIV prevalence and associated risk factors such as substance use and condomless anal sex. Furthermore, the high prevalence of these factors in samples comprised mostly or entirely of immigrant MSM gives credit to the hypothesis that transational migration is part of a syndemic.
87;In this sample of MSM living in China, a significant proportion of respondent had at least two syndemic conditions which was associated with higher odds of engaging in condomless anal sex
88;Psychosocial strengths were associated with a lesser odds of engagement in condomless anal sex, despite the presence of syndemic conditions. Psychosocial strenghts may operate in the same way as syndemic conditions but in an opposite direction.
90;31 resilience ressources were identified, with the most frequently cited being social support and incomes. Most of these resources were associated with a lower HIV risk.
92;The study found evidence of a predictive ability of syndemic factors on sexual risk behaviors but there were no association with HIV/STI incidence.  Furthermore, Black YMSM had both the highest seroconversion rate in the sample and a lesser burden in syndemic conditons compared to White and Latino YMSM, questioning the usefulness of syndemic theory on Black MSM or the need to take into account other syndemic conditions to explain the high rates of HIV acquisition among Black MSM
95;Among MSM living with HIV, functional social support moderates the effect of syndemic conditions on viral load suppression, providing a significant protective effect
96;There is a high reported frequency of sexual violence among MSM in Tijuana. Furthermore, the authors suggest a model of co-occurring psychosocial factors such as CSA, adult homophobia, depressive symptoms and hostility that increase the odds of sexual violence experiences among MSM
99;In this sample of Indian MSM, there was a positive relationship between the number of syndemic conditions and sexual risk taking. This relationship was moderated by resilient coping but not by social support.
101;90% of this sample of Latino MSM reported at least one syndemic condition and having a greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher odds of CAS and multiple sexual partners
106;Young Black MSM experimenting syndemic conditions have more conflicted identities, notably between their racial and sexual identities, and are disconnected both from their family and the gay community. Sense of community may thus be an important mediator between adversity and syndemics
107;In this sample of Latino MSM, predictors of HIV seroconversion included history of STI, condomless anal sex, Methamphetamine Use, Central American birthplace, experience of IPV and same ethnicity of last sexual partner.
109;Poorer glycemic control was associated with a detectable viral load, high triglycerides and substance use
110;Experimenting syndemic conditions was associated with less engagement in HIV-related care, uptake of ART and adherence to ART among this sample of HIV positive MSM living in Latin America
114;The sum of syndemic conditions experienced by the partners in a couple was associated with condomless sex during first sexual intercourse and with non-disclosure of HIV status prior to first condomless anal sex
115;A higher number of syndemic conditions was associated with greater suicidal ideation among MSM, especially when the number of syndemic conditions reaches five. Among these conditions, only involuntary subordination and sexual risk taking remained significant in multivariate analysis
117;The number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher odds of engaging in condomless anal sex with a stranger. This effect was more pronounced in MSM who are out to less than 50% of their acquaintances
121;In this population-based study of Indian MSM, the authors found empiric support to three models of interacting epidemics : synergistically interacting epidemics, serially causal epidemics and mutually causal epidemics, with the strongest support for the model of synergistically interacting epidemics
124;In this sample of MSM living with HIV, the number of syndemic conditions was associated with ART adherence, having one syndemic condition was associated with inpatient medical admissions in the past year. Serodiscordant condomless anal sex was not associated with the syndemic count variable
135;he number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher odds of engaging in CAS and self-report of HIV diagnosis
140;The number of syndemic conditions mediated the relationship between childhood physical abuse and sexual risk as well as between verbal victimization and sexual risk
141;In this sample of highly sexually active MSM, sexual compulsivity and hypersexuality seemed to act as a syndemic condition associated with an increase in HIV risk rather than as a mediator of syndemic conditions on HIV risk. Furthermore, these findings provide support for a three group conceptualization of hypersexuality and sexual compulsivity (one, both or none)
142;Compared to White MSM, Black MSM experienced a wide range of disparities such as substance use, substance use disorder, exchange sex, unstable housing, unemployment, low educational attainment, arrest history, low social support and low satisfaction with one's living situation
143;In this longitudinal study, the sum of syndemic conditions was associated with lower ART adherence and higher viral load among MSM living with HIV. Furthermore, the effect of syndemic conditions on viral load was partially mediated by ART adherence.
144;MSM with encounters with 4 or more partners constitute a particularly high risk subgroup of MSM,  with more condomless anal sex, polysubstance use, STI diagnosis and HIV prevalence. Furthermore, a higher count of syndemic conditions was associated with odds of participating in encounters with 4 or more partners.
148;In this longitudinal study, experiencing a greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher odds of HIV seroconversion over the 4-years follow-up and this effect was partially mediated by sexual risk behaviors
149;There was an increased use of substance and sexual risk behaviors with increasing age of this cohort of YMSM. Furthermore, the relative contribution of the syndemic indicator variables on the latent constructs varied accros time while still loading onto one latent construct across the four time points
153;A greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with increased odds of sexual risk behaviors. Furthermore, experiences of adversity play an important role  in syndemic formation and syndemic conditions mediate the pathway from adversity to sexual risk behaviors
154;In this study, constraining factor loadings to be equal, as it is done with summary score of syndemic conditions, significantly reduced model fit. In the other hand, a latent class analysis produced two ordinal categories of low syndemic burden and high syndemic burden, which is consistent with an underlying unidimensional syndemic stress factor
155;A higher number of syndemic conditions was significantly associated with greater odds of condomless anal sex, a higher HIV prevalence and a higher HIV incidence
157;Experiencing a higher number of syndemic conditions was associated with greater odds of engaging in condomless anal sex and a higher prevalence of self-reported positive HIV status. Optimism and education buffered the relationship between syndemic conditions and self-reported HIV status but other resilience factors (connection to gay community, religiosity, Black pride and income) did not. Furthermore, none of the resilience factors buffered the relationship between syndemic conditions and sexual risk behaviors
161;Experiencing a higher number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher odds of engaging in condomless anal sex and self-reported positive HIV status
163;Experiences of victimization and bullying increased the syndemic burden of all youths and subsequently syndemic burden increased suicide attempts. These findings held true for young men who have sex with women (YMSW), young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young men who have sex with men and women (YMSMW). However, these relationships were much stronger among sexual minority youths and syndemic conditions clustered with particular strength among YMSMW
164;Experiencing multiple anti-gay experiences was associated with syndemic conditions : a greater number of syndemic conditions was then subsequently associated with greater odds of engaging in serodiscordant condomless anal sex
165;Experiencing a higher number of syndemic condition was associated with greater odds of engaging in condomless anal sex in this sample of Vietnamese male sex workers who have sex with men. This relationship was mainly driven by childhood sexual abuse and alcohol use disorder
167;Depressive symptoms and sexual sensation seeking were more present in MSM who engaged in condomless anal sex in the past 6 months while use of alcohol or substance or alcohol just before or during sex was not. However, this study found no evidence that depressive symptoms moderated the effect of risk perception of condomless anal sex on engaging in condomless anal sex.
168;Among MSMW, syndemic conditions explained 31,1% of the variance in exchange sex but only 3.6% of the variance in chemsex. Exchange sex, in turn was associated with serodiscordant condomless anal sex while chemsex alone was not. Furthermore no direct association between syndemic conditions and serodiscodant condomless anal was found
171;In multivariate analysis, self-reported positive HIV status and childhood sexual abuse were associated with higher odds of reporting sex with both men and women. Furthermore recent interpartner violence, recent sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse were significantly inter-associated but were not associated with sexual risk or substance/alcohol use
172;High prevalence of smoking was found in this sample of Chinese MSM and the level of smoking was associated with alcohol use, substance use and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, sexual risk taking was positively associated with smoking, alcohol use,  substance use and IPV
173;In this life-course approach of syndemic production among MSM, current forms of adversity (i.e. event discrimination, current marginalization and general life satisfaction) accounted for the largest contribution to the model while early life events also contributed significantly with childhood victimization and self-perception of failing masculinity attainment remaining significantly associated to the syndemic outcome variable after controlling for all other factors
174;A second-order model consisting of drug use and mental health burden was associated with a first-order model for unprotected sex, both indicated by numerous variables
175;Serosorting among MSM living with HIV was positively associated with lower levels of cognitive escape and higher levels of two resilience factors : coping self-efficacy and positive coping skills. Among HIV-negative men, serosorting was positively associated with lower levels of cognitive escape, violence victimization and severe mental distress as well as with higher levels of coping self-efficacy and social engagements and with lower levels of negative coping skills
176;Experiencing a greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with sexual risk behaviors and HIV infection and the relationship between syndemic conditions and HIV infection seems to be partially mediated by sexual risk behaviors
177;Gay-related and non-gay-related victimization in school, perception of failures in masculinity, social connectedness, internalized homophobia, discrimination and life satisfaction were associated with having 2 or more syndemic conditions. Furthermore, having 3 or more syndemic conditions was associated with condomless anal sex
178;Sexual compulsivity was significantly associated with depression and IPV in multivariate analysis, as well as with self-reported positive HIV status and serodiscordant condomless anal sex. Furthermore, experiencing a greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher odds of engaging in sexual risk behaviors and reporting a positive HIV status
181;YMSM who reported smoking cigarettes were more likely to use marijuana, cocaine, inhalant nitrates, ecstasy, methamphetamine, hallucinogens, Adderall/Ritalin without prescription and to use alcohol until intoxication. Furthermore, they were also more likely to ingage in sexual risk behaviors such as use of substance before or during sex
182;Emotional neglect in childhood and demographic factors influenced self-esteem which, in turn, along with substance use and several demographic and psychological functioning variables, influenced attitudes toward condom. This last variable predicted engagement in condomless anal and oral sex
183;The results of this study suggests links between experiences of marginalization in childhood/aolescence and subsequent search for gay peers and migration to larger city and/or gay neighboorhood. This migration exposes YMSM to a range of risk factors such as experimentation with substance and sex. Compared to straight youth, this risk may be heightened due to lack of support. On the other hand, access to gay spaces also offers resilience resources such as a sense of community and peer support.
190;Experiencing a greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher odds of condomless anal sex, multiple sex partners and reported positive HIV status
220;Compared to straight men, MSM had greater odds of having experienced childhood adversity, IPV, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Furthermore experiencing a greater number of syndemic condition was associated with higher odds of engaging in sexual risk behaviors
224;Experiencing a greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with higher odds of self-reported postive HIV status but not with condomless anal sex nor number of partners
233;Gay men were more likely to experiment two or more syndemic conditions compared to bisexual men and female-partnered MSM. This difference was mainly driven by higher odds of consuming party drugs and being treated for anxiety/depression. Furthermore, being single, younger than 45 years old, of Indigenous ancestry, earning less than $60,000 per year and living in an urban environment were also associated with higher odds of experimenting two or more syndemic conditions
282;A high burden of mental health problem was found in this sample of MSM PrEP Users. Using self-administered questionnaire was a feasible and useful strategy for screening those conditions
342;A greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with condomless anal sex with both HIV-positive and HIV-negative partners but not with HIV status
367;In this sample of Malaysian MSM, condomless anal sex was associated with depression and chemsex while self-reported HIV status was associated with depression, suicidal risk, chemsex and a history of CSA. Furthermore, self-reported HIV status was associated with the number of syndemic conditions
395;Some of the men interviewed in this study found safety from family in school but a more sizeable part encoutered bullying which compounded their distress at home. Furthermore, some found refuges from hostile home and school environment through books, pop culture and internet chat. Finally, during adolescence a subset of men experienced sexual relationships with older men who brought emotional stability and personal growth
477;In this sample of transgender MSM, syndemic conditions were associated with higher odds of engaging in condomless vaginal and/or anal sex and this association was fully moderated by social gender affirmation, suggesting similar sexual risk patterns for TMSM who have socially afirmed their gender identity as for cisgender MSM
488;Religion and spirituality have mixed effect on syndemic conditions of MSM but may be more beneficial for the health of MSM of color than for white MSM. All in all, religion and spirituality was completey absent from syndemic quantitative research and very sparse in syndemic conditions research focused on MSM
643;A greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with positive HIV status and sexual risk behaviors
648;6 clusters with diverse patterns of sexual risk taking and STI/HIV vulnerability were identified. Among these clusters, the one with the highest HIV prevalence was the oldest one, reported the most condomless anal sex and had sex the most frequently with transgender partners, women and sex workers.
649;This syndemic-based intervention to enhance help-seeking among high-risk MSM failed to improve help-seeking behaviours, STI incidence and sexual risk. Nonetheless, the extremely high incidence of STI incidence and mental health-related problems call for other type of interventions.
675;Geographic mobility represents a syndemic condition in itself as it was found to magnify many HIV risk factors such as racism, lack of social cohesion or place attachement, barriers to HIV care and high-risk sexual encounters. When, geographic mobility was tied with housing instability, its direct contribution to the syndemic was found to be above and beyond its role in housing insecurity
676;Using latent transition analysis, three profiles of high-risk syndemic status with different proportions of syndemic factors and a low risk profile were identified. Moreover, social support strongly moderated the association between these profiles and substance use at 12 months in that BMSM with better social support had more chance to stay in the low risk profile or to transition from high risk to low risk.
682;Problematic alcohol use and cocaine use were found to be additively associated with PrEP nonadherence but no synergy were found between these two conditions. Furthermore, depression was not shown to be associated with PrEP nonadherence in this sample
685;Different syndemic profiles were found for BMSMO and BMSMW. Furthermore BMSMO had higher STI incidence compared to BMSMW and this difference in incidence was partly mediated by high risk sexual behaviors.
699;Four classes of syndemic conditions were identified and class membership was associated with HIV risk behaviors. Notably, the MSM concurrently engaging in polysubstance use and living with HIV engaged in more HIV risk behaviors while MSM presenting higher levels of alcohol misuses demonstrated reduced HIV risk behaviors.
702;In this sample of BMSM engaged in sex work, there were a direct relationship between syndemic conditions and engagement in sex work as well as between engagement in sex work and past-year STI diagnosis. Furthermore, syndemic conditions were found to partially mediate the relationship between engagement in sex work and past-year STI, accounting for 64,2% of this relationship.
708;MSM with a lower socio-economical status were less likely to be aware of PrEP and experiencing multiple syndemic conditions was associated with reduced odds of using PrEP although, taken independently, these conditions were not associated with PrEP use
775;Employing synergy factor analysis on the data set from Stall et al. this studies demonstrated a synergy among substance use, violence and HIV among white MSM in the sample. No synergy was found for other racial group
782;Taiwanese MSM were burdened with a high level of syndemic conditions and people experienceing more syndemic conditions were more likely to engage in condomless anal sex  or report a positive HIV status. Furthermore three 2-ways and two 3-ways interactive effects on HIV infection were identified
789;Ecological factors such as economic vulnerability and anti-Black or homophobic violence had an influence on situational sex (drug use during sex and exchange sex) via depression
790;This sample of male sex workers who have sex with men was burdened with a high prevalence of syndemic conditions. Furthermore, a higher count of syndemic condition was associated with higher odds of engaging in condomless anal sex
793;This study showed an effect of the number of syndemic conditions on HIV transmissions over and above time in care
797;Experiencing a greater number of syndemic conditions was associated with elevations in rectal cytokines relevant to HIV/STI acquisition
