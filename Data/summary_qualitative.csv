Quinn,2019,USA,46,25,,thematic_content,,,,,,Yes,BMSM,No,Yes,"Intersectional structural violence (e.g. racial neighborhood segregation, poverty, unemployment, violence, unstable housing, incarceration and poor healthcare access) leads to expectations surrounding masculinity which conflicts with the sexual orientation of BMSM and results in internalized homophobia. Internalized homophobia, in turn, produce poor mental health, suicidal ideation as well as substance abuse and sexual risk taking as a coping mechanism. Furthermore, the use of PrEP, perceived as a “gay pill” is less often considered. This all leads to an increase in HIV infection.","Intersectionality provides the context needed to understand syndemics among BMSM, which differs from syndemics among white MSM due to intersecting stigma and harmful social conditions unique to BMSM. These structural inequities, notably racial neighborhood segregation, shape the expectations surrounding masculinity, which result in societal and internalized homophobia, producing distress, depression, suicidal ideation, substance use and HIV risk behavior.",Intersectionality
"Maionara et al.",2020,USA,25,,,,thematic,,,,,Yes,YBMSM,No,Yes,"Economic dependency and fear of violence may maintain YBMSM in dysfunctional relationships plagued by intimate partner violence and substance abuse which increase their odds of incarceration and HIV infection. Their criminal records may then prevent YBMSM from achieving formal employment. Methamphetamine is a way of coping with this structural violence and eventual HIV diagnosis but represents a potential factor in transmitting HIV to others, notably during sex parties.","Methamphetamine use, intimate partner violence and incarceration may form a syndemic in the lives of young black men who have sex with men, increasing their vulnerability of acquiring or transmitting HIV",
"Lyons et al.",2013,USA,21,,grounded,,,,,,,Yes,HIV+YMSM,No,Yes,"The marginalization of YMSM within their school, communities of origin and families result in a lack of gay-specific HIV prevention education, role model and productive goal-related activities, all of them being linked to HIV infection.","Alcohol use, substance use, marginalization, family rejection, lack of social support and lack of gay-specific HIV prevention as well as role models contributed to the HIV infection in YMSM.",
"Chakrapani et al.",2019,India,33,27,,,,framework,,,,No,,No,Yes,"Multiple forms of intersecting stigma (i.e. same-sex sexuality, gender non-conformity, sex work and socio-economic stigmas) contribute to the production of syndemic conditions (i.e. depression, suicidality, internalized homonegativity, violence and problematic alcohol use as a coping strategy) which in turn increase HIV risk. Family support and communities of MSM may serve as a resilience resource and counteract the negative effects of stigma and syndemic conditions.","Intersecting stigma related to same-sex attraction, gender non-conformity and sex work contribute to the production of syndemic conditions which may in turn increase sexual risk behaviors. Family and community of MSM may serve as resilience and counteract the effects of stigma and syndemic conditions",Resilience
"Pollard et al.",2018,England,15,,,,,framework,,,,No,,No,Yes,"Maladaptive coping strategies to minority stress and the performative resistant space of the gay scene contribute to chemsex use and HIV risks","The experience of chemsex and HIV-risk is entangled in complex narratives in which drug use is related to marginalisation, loneliness and a gay scene that acted both as a space of personal affirmation and resistance and as a barrier to fulfilling psychosocial needs such as meaningful emotional conections.","Minority Stress"
"Adam et al.",2017,Canada,40,38,,,thematic,,,,,No,,No,No,,"Life story interviews of MSM affected by at least two syndemic conditions revealed one major pathway of syndemic production (childhood adversity leading to depression, substance abuse and risk taking) and two minor modes characterised by migration stress or transition stress from home to college or work. Furthermore, risk practice fell into different subjectivities (active and consistent pursuit of condomless sex, lack of assertiveness to a partner's initiative of CAS and combination of risk reduction strategies)",
"Reed et al.",2016,USA,46,,,,,,,analytic_induction,,Yes,YBMSM,No,No,,"Young Black MSM experimenting syndemic conditions have more conflicted identities, notably between their racial and sexual identities, and are disconnected both from their family and the gay community. Sense of community may thus be an important mediator between adversity and syndemics",Resilience
"Bruce et al.",2011,USA,54,,,,thematic,,,,cross_case,Yes,HIV+YMSM,No,No,,"The results of this study suggests links between experiences of marginalization in childhood/aolescence and subsequent search for gay peers and migration to larger city and/or gay neighboorhood. This migration exposes YMSM to a range of risk factors such as experimentation with substance and sex. Compared to straight youth, this risk may be heightened due to lack of support. On the other hand, access to gay spaces also offers resilience resources such as a sense of community and peer support.",
"Adam et al.",2018,Canada,40,38,,,,,comparative,,,No,,No,No,,"Some of the men interviewed in this study found safety from family in school but a more sizeable part encoutered bullying which compounded their distress at home. Furthermore, some found refuges from hostile home and school environment through books, pop culture and internet chat. Finally, during adolescence a subset of men experienced sexual relationships with older men who brought emotional stability and personal growth",Resilience
"Cassels et al.",2020,USA,20,32,,,thematic,,,,,Yes,LB_MSM,No,No,,"Geographic mobility represents a syndemic condition in itself as it was found to magnify many HIV risk factors such as racism, lack of social cohesion or place attachement, barriers to HIV care and high-risk sexual encounters. When, geographic mobility was tied with housing instability, its direct contribution to the syndemic was found to be above and beyond its role in housing insecurity",
