  abstract = {Gay men in the United States are characterized by a higher prevalence rate for a series of psychosocial and biomedical health problems compared to heterosexual men in the U.S. This chapter presents a theoretical framework to explain higher prevalence rates among gay and bisexual men that can be used as the basis for public health interventions. The theory takes a life course perspective on the development of health problems among gay men, and describes the development of these problems as a syndemic process of interacting health problems that begin at an early age among gay male adolescents. The current dominant explanations for lower health profiles among gay men are that homophobia causes poor health in men. This chapter adds to that explanation the possibility that the lifelong effects of experiencing homophobic violence and cultural marginalization at a very early age is a centrally-important force in syndemic production among gay men. \textcopyright{} 2008 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

  abstract = {Historically, HIV studies have conflated men who have sex with men (MSM) with transgender (trans) women, explicitly excluded trans individuals, or included sample sizes of trans people that are too small to reach meaningful conclusions. Despite the heavy burden of HIV among trans women, conflation of this population with MSM has limited the information available on the social and behavioural factors that increase HIV vulnerability among trans women and how these factors may differ from MSM. Using data sets from quantitative studies among MSM (n = 645) and trans women (n = 89), as well as qualitative in-depth interviews with 30 trans women in Baltimore, we explore what these data tell us about similarities and differences in HIV vulnerability between the two groups and where they leave gaps in our understanding. We conclude with implications for data collection and intervention development.},
