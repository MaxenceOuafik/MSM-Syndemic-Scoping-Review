# This data frame corresponds to the numbers and cumulative 
# numbers of studies by type, in order to create the plot used in the paper. 
# To improve readability of the plot , we decided to merge some of the design, 
# using a mix of  ifelse function and grepl function. Case series was merged with 
# cross-sectional  because we only had one case-series in our review (Tan et al. 2016)
# and because this study also had a cross-sectional part.
